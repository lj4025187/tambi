Wordlist is an Arabeyes project for/by its volunteers to create a GPLed
English/Arabic dictionary.  Wordlist is comprised of 26 .po files; each
file contains a good portion of the English language words.

English words that begin with the letter 'A' are stored in the file
full_wordlist_A.po, words that begin with the letter 'B' are stored in
full_wordlist_B.po, etc, etc.

The files might not be of value without further processing.  As such a
sample perl script (po2dict.pl) is provided to export all 26 .po files
into an understandable format which a dictd server can comprehend.
Please refer to INSTALL for how to use these files in a fruitful manner.

This project doesn't currently have a completion date associated with
it since it's a rather fluid/ongoing effort by many volunteers to add
and enhance the content of the dictionary at hand.
