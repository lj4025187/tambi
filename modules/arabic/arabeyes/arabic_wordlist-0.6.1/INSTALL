Via dictd
-----------

To prepare all 26 files to be used with a dictd server, one has to
follow these steps:

1) Make sure you have dictd & dictfmt installed on your *nix machine. On
   Debian, run the following command as 'root' to fetch the above from your
   Debian repository 

     apt-get install dictd dictfmt

2) Run the 'scripts/po2dictd' script to generate "arabic.dict" 
and "arabic.index", the Arabic dictionary and index files.

   the Arabic dictionary and index files.
   
     http://cvs.arabeyes.org/viewcvs/translate/wordlist/scripts/

   Those files will be copied to the place where you keep your dictionary
   files under dictd (where dictd stores its dictionary and index files).
   in This case they will be stored in "/usr/share/dictd".

3) Restart your dictd process. On Debian, run the following as 'root':

     /etc/init.d/dictd restart

You can see the results by pointing your dictionary client like kdict
or gdict to the machine running 'dictd' and fetch for and English word
and hope to find a suitable translation.
